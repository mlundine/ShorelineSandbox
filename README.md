# ShorelineSandbox
Exploring the limits of satellite shorelines with synthetic data.

Can we see more in these datasets currently other than big trends?

Help wanted...

# Road Map

Part 1:

Make a bunch of synthetic timeseries with known processes input.

See how much noise and data gaps we can add until any meaning is lost.

Part 2:

Similarly, make a bunch of synthetic timeseries with known processes input

See how much noise and data gaps we can add until an ML model fails at producing accurate predictions.

Part 3:

Look at actual satellite-derived shoreline data and see where on the spectrum it falls. Try to identify necessary areas to improve.

Part 4:

Can we reproduce Cosmos-Coast through machine learning?
