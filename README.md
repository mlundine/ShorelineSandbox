# ShorelineSandbox
Exploring the limits of satellite shorelines with synthetic data.

Can we see more in these datasets currently other than big trends?

Help wanted...

# Road Map

1. Generate synthetic timeseries matrices that mimic satellite shoreline data.

2. See how much noise and data gaps we can add until we can't decompose the signal properly. Determine best practices for timeseries interpolation.

3. Train data-driven models to forecast the synthetic timeseries. See what causes this to succeed/fail.

4. Use what we learn and apply to actual satellite shoreline timeseries data.
